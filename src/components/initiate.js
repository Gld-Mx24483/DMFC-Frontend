        <h1>Dalmach Initiative Program</h1>
        <p className="initiate-slogan">Equipping young folks for greater impact</p>
        <p>
          Dalmach Initiative is a dedicated platform under Dalmach Foundation aimed at equipping passionate individuals aged between 12 and 20 years with essential skills provided by the foundation to help them stand out in society.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grand vision of this initiative is to establish an academy where we impart skills to young individuals, especially those less privileged. This initiative aims to raise an intelligentsia, reduce poverty, and diminish criminal activities in the country and Africa at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          We envision organizing skill acquisition events once or twice a year, allowing interested and qualified participants within the specified age range to register through the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interested participants can visit the website, register for any available skill they're interested in learning, and participate in the skill acquisition program. At the end of the event, certificates will be awarded to all participants, and prizes will be given to the top three performers in each skill field.
        </p>
